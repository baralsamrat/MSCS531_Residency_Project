# Residency Project: Designing and Implementing a Microprocessor Using gem5 Simulation Software 


## [Project Objective](./project/Residency%20Project.pdf) 

### Designing and Implementing a Microprocessor Using Gem5 Simulation Software

This part of the final project challenges you to utilize gem5, a widely-used computer architecture 
simulator, to design and implement a low-power microprocessor. You will define the architectural 
specifications, implement the design, conduct simulations to evaluate performance and power 
consumption, and optimize your design based on the results. The culmination of your efforts will be 
a comprehensive project report and an oral presentation demonstrating your microprocessor 
design's efficacy and energy efficiency
